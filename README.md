Several computations involving Exact Diagonalization of 1-dimensional spin systems, adiabatic gauge potentials and maximal reduction of symmetry based on used-defined operators.

Locality tests for nearest neighbour Ising chains with maximal basis reduced computation for highest machine efficiency, for chains with upto 10-spin locality.

To be continued..
